# Select by Indent

This simple extension adds one command: "Expand Selection by Indentation Level".
It works much like other expand selection commands but uses the indentation
level as the cue to determine where and by how much the indentation level expands.

This has just the one command for the moment. Future plans include a more
python friendly version of the command and the ability to move to the
start or end of a given indentation level.

There are currently no default keybindings for the command.
