# Select by Indent

This simple extension adds one command: "Expand Selection by Indentation Level".
It works much like other expand selection commands but uses the indentation
level as the cue to determine where and by how much the selection expands.

This has just the one command for the moment. Future plans include the ability
to move to the start or end of a given indentation level.

There are currently no default keybindings for the command. You can add new
keybindings by running the `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts` command
(⌘K ⌘S on mac, or ^K, ^S on windows or linux).
