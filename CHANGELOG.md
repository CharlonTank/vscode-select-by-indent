# Change Log

## 0.0.3

- added explicit "top-only" version of command; this ensures proper selection
in a python style indentation layout (note that the original command already
does this properly if there is a space after each indent block)

## 0.0.2

- more friendly selection behavior: don't expand lower line if line above it is
whitespace (ala python)

## 0.0.1

- Initial release
